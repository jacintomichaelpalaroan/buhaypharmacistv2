						Pharmacists have an opportunity to change healthcare by increasing their professional value in today's healthcare system, according to Dr. Rajiv R. Shah, this year's keynote speaker at the 2016 American Pharmacists Association annual meeting in Baltimore. The healthcare system is changing dramatically, in part because patients want to get involved, access their healthcare records, and become real partners in their care. But while today's healthcare-team model encompasses the patient, physician, nurse, and specialists, it is still very physician-centered. That model needs to change, said Shah, a nephrologist from Minneapolis and the entrepreneur behind MyMeds (www.My-Meds.com), a medication adherence platform designed to enable patients, physicians, and pharmacists to work together for better patient outcomes. <a href="http://www.drugtopics.com/health-system-news/pharmacists-and-patient-care-bring-value">Read more&gt;&gt;</a>

						Medication management is a service designed to help individuals manage their medications so they take them on time, all the time, and avoid the dangers of incorrect medication administration. This service is often used in assisted living settings and senior living communities.
					</p>
					<p>
						For some people, simply using an over-the-counter reminder device is sufficient in making sure they take their medications as prescribed, but for others, more advanced, consistent reminders and help is necessary. In many assisted living settings, residents receive medication management services from trained licensed and unlicensed staff to ensure all prescriptions are filled on time and all medications are taken correctly on a daily basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether someone neglects to take their medications properly because they forget or think they don't need it, the fact is, failing to do so can lead to serious consequences. Through medication management, individuals get the medications they need, on time, every single day.  <a href="http://blog.walkermethodist.org/blog/the-importance-of-medication-management">Read more&gt;&gt;</a>
